<h3>Script to track my amortization from having bought myself a bike. Basically a script that brings in activities from Strava, filters them and sends the activities that correspond to commutes to a spreadsheet where I calculate said amortization and other stuff. I scrape a public transport webpage to get the fare for the ride.</h3>
